# Question
Welcome to the fourth of our five Metadata Games: Location Data. Gather your community and work on the first task. ðŸ‘€ðŸŸ¡

Itâ€™s amazing how little information you need to pinpoint someoneâ€™s location anywhere on earth. ðŸŒŽ

Part 1: Which country were these five photos taken in? For bonus points, can you find their exact location?

The photos are designed to be confusing / misleading, but they havenâ€™t been altered: https://medium.com/hoprnet/metadata-games-4-location-data-c73476b860a3

Part 2: Each team should submit their own photo. If any people are in the photo, please use the yellow HOPR ball to obscure them. Photos should show somewhere outside, and that location should be visible on Google Earth or Google Maps.

Points will be awarded if the judge confidently guesses the wrong country. The idea is to be misleading, but interesting. So arbitrarily difficult photos are unlikely to do well.

Each team must provide five guesses for Part 1 and one entry for Part 2 by 2pm CEST on Sunday June 12th ðŸ“·
