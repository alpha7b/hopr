# Question
Welcome to the last of our five Metadata Games: Wallet / IP Addresses. Gather your community and work on the next task. 👀🟡

DERP (derp.hoprnet.org) has been a cornerstone of our outreach to other projects, highlighting just how far web3 and crypto have to go to provide a sufficient level of privacy. 🔐

The DERP site has three examples of how crypto services leak your data – we’d like you to find some more. The most interesting example with the best explanation will win. 👀

🛑 While submitting your entry, which is ideally a video of DERP in action, please don’t doxx yourself. 

Each team should submit one entry by 2pm CEST on Monday June 13th.
